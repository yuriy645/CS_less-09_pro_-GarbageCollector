## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-09_pro_ GarbageCollector
1. Create your own class whose objects will take up a lot of memory space (for example, in
    there will be a large array in the class code) and implement a formalized cleanup pattern for this class.
2. Create a class that will allow you to monitor the resources used by the program.
    Use it to monitor the operation of the program, namely: the user can
    specify acceptable levels of resource (memory) consumption, and class methods will allow you to issue
    a warning when the amount of actually used resources approaches the maximum allowable level.
